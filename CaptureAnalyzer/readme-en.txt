We use this file to analyze our captures.

Use the Aircrack-ng to catch the data, which includes the WPA 4-handshakes

(You can check the existence and the completion by WireShark. If the descriptions of some frames as "Key(Message of ...)", and "..." are replaced by all numbers from 1 to 4, then you caught complete 4-handshake messages, and can be analyzed. Otherwise, returns nothing.)
